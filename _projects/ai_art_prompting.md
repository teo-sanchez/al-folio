# What is prompting? 

2021 witnessed the development of artificial neural networks that can learn visual concepts from natural language supervision <d-cite key="radford2021learning"></d-cite>.
These models can be used to generate captions from images (image captioning) but also generate images from captions (text-to-image generation). 

Democratized by Midjourney, OpenAI (DALL-E), or Stability.AI (Stable Diffusion), text-to-image generators were trained on billions of annotated images, particularly artistic images.
The images generated by such models not only reproduce the training set but also create new subjects and aesthetics, acting as imagination amplifiers.
Online communities have been growing ever since, creating millions of new images every day.

This article is particularly interested in AI art prompting practices.
It is both a tutorial and preliminary research results from AI art prompts collected from the online communities on discord.

# Prompting as a dynamic process

Anyone who has tried text-to-image generation can notice that:

- **You won't get what you want from the first attempt**: you must refine your prompt to generate an appealing image.

- **Intermediate images might affect what you are looking for**: new ideas might arise when generating with AI


- **The same prompt might result in different images**: text-to-image models use random noise as a starting image. There are then infinite alternatives for one prompt. Generating a batch of images is a powerful practice to know what you can get from a prompt.

As with any tool, your prompting skills will improve with trial and error. The best way to get on board with AI art is to try it!

# Prompting as a multi-dimensionnal exploration

The prompt is the medium for exploring the depths of the machine learning model’s knowledge. 
A text-to-image generative model tries to map a sentence into a lower dimensional vector representing visual concepts.
Consequently, appending words describing the different aspects of an image is the most common way to refine the result. Beside the main subject, the appended words to change the image are usually called **prompt specifiers**.

**Let's practice!** You wrote a detective novel taking place in Amsterdam in the 1930s and you want to design the book cover.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        <h3>Subject</h3>
        Of course, we first need to describe our subject:
        <br>
        <code>a detective walking in Amsterdam in the 1930s </code>
        <br>
        It seems that the specifier <code>1930s</code> largely prevails in defining the style of the image.
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/prompting/amsterdam1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image" width="70%"/>
    </div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        <h3>Type of content</h3>
        From the last prompt, the model infered a photography but many other physical support exist. Let's precise that we want a painting:
        <br>
        <code>a painting of a detective walking in Amsterdam in the 1930s </code>
        <br>
        Feel free to explore other lesser known physical support or art practices (lithography, woodcutting, etc.)
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/prompting/amsterdam2.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image" width="70%"/>
    </div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        <h3>Light</h3>
        Light is crucial in photography and cinema. The jargon is vast to describe it!
        <br>
        <code>a painting of a detective walking in Amsterdam in the 1930s, low-angled light, sunrise, foggy</code>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/prompting/amsterdam3.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image" width="70%"/>
    </div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        <h3>Artistic inspirations</h3>
         Art movements or artists' names can be used to convey certain aesthetics.
        <br>
        <code>a painting of a detective walking in Amsterdam in the 1930s, low-angled light, sunrise, foggy, by Carl Spitzweg and Edward Hopper</code>
        <br>
        You can use more than one artistic influence to explore new territories.
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/prompting/amsterdam4.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image" width="70%"/>
    </div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        <h3>Composition</h3>
        Improving the general composition can be achieved by invoking symetry, camera angle, or online platforms gathering the best pieces (artstation):
        <br>
        <code> a painting of a detective walking in Amsterdam in the 1930s, low-angled light, sunrise, foggy, by Carl Spitzweg and Edward hopper, golden ratio, dutch angle, trending on artstation</code>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/prompting/amsterdam5.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image" width="70%"/>
    </div>
</div>

<br>
<br>
In short, the palette of the prompt artist is words. Enriching your vocabulary to describe an image will help you generate appealing and novel images with AI.
Photography, cinema, painting, and art history will provide you with numerous terms and references that can be endlessly combined.

To help you in this process, we mapped thousands of specifiers extracted from 1.5 million prompts (Stable Diffusion).
This topic analysis was made with the [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) python library.

# Virality of prompt specifiers

An important aspect is that prompts are shared, gathered, and re-used among online communities on discord or Reddit.
Consequently, prompt specifiers can become viral.


Greg Rutkowski is a digital artist mainly painting heroic fantasy scenes. 
His name became viral in august 2022 among text-to-image prompts: `by Greg Rutkowski`, `in  the style of Greg Rutkowski`, etc.
The trend around his work is discussed in [this article from the MIT Technological Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/?utm_medium=tr_social&utm_source=LinkedIn&utm_campaign=site_visitor.unpaid.engagement). 

Interestingly, Greg Rutkowski work is far from being the most represented in the [LAION-5B](https://laion-aesthetic.datasette.io/laion-aesthetic-6pls/images), the data set used to train Stable Diffusion <d-footnote> For more insights on this data set, refers to <a href="https://waxy.org/2022/08/exploring-12-million-of-the-images-used-to-train-stable-diffusions-image-generator/"> Andy Baio's analysis</a>.</d-footnote>.
The fact that text-to-image generators can adopt an artist's style, even under-represented in the training set, raises concerns among artists asking for permission and proper attribution when models are trained on their work.

# Beyond prompting

If there is already a lot to do only with text prompts, new techniques offering innovative workflows are being developed:

- **Pseudo-prompting** refers to the use of randomness and combinatorics to generate text prompts,
- **Image2image** enables to modify an existing image with a prompt,
- **Inpainting and outpainting** allows for regenerating a selected part, within or without the original image,
- **Image2text** (or clip interrogator) enables to approximate text prompts from existing images,
- **Face Restoration algorithms** allow to fix inconsistencies in character's facial features,
- **Textual inversion** <d-cite key="gal2022image"></d-cite> uses new training data to create an additional word token. The new token can then be used to condition the generation on the trained aesthetic,
- **Interoperability with traditional graphical tools** <d-footnote> <a href="https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/114117da/stable-diffusion" target="_blank"> Photoshop plugin are now accessibles https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/114117da/stable-diffusion</a></d-footnote> such as Adobe Photoshop, provide workflows with AI generation anchored into existing artistic practices.

# Conclusion

Prompting is a new approach to interacting with machine learning models, particularly image generators.
It is unlikely to replace existing digital art practices but instead offers new workflows to work with digital media.
If important authorship issues must be addressed, it also offers new ways to express and share ideas and emotions, accessible to the general public.
