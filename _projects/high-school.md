I  was contacted by the association [TRACES](https://www.groupe-traces.fr/?lang=en) to conduct workshops with students from the highschool [Isaac Newton](https://www.lycee-newton.fr/) in Clichy (92100).

I conducted two workshops in may 2021, with small groups of students (aged around  17 yo) and with the help from Arnaud Malher from the association.

# Structure of the workshop

The workshop last around 1 hour 45 minutes including:

- 35 min: Presentations and walkthough on definitions of AI students wrote;
- 50 min: Short activities I designed using Interactive Machine Learning;
- 20 min: Open Q&A.

# Defining AI

Here is the translated definitions of AI that students came up with:

### Group 1

**Definition 1**: *"AI refers to many developments related to new technologies. They are recent and have experienced a boom from the 21st century. These new technologies are mainly associated with creations like intelligent cars, machine learning, robots. The objects designed are generally autonomous and independent."*

**Definition 2** : *"Autonomous algorithmic program created by man capable of learning and adapting to time!"*

**Definition 3** : *"It is an autonomous and discrete technology, allowing to replace some human activities. It brings advantages like Elon Musk with his electric car Tesla which allows to improve road safety (and to pollute less) but also disadvantages like in agriculture which causes the loss of jobs."*

### Group2

**Definition 4**; *"Program realized by a human allowing to recreate a computer brain. This one executes or not complex tasks faster than the human. It may have the ability to learn over time."*

**Definition 5**: *"Computer science based on several algorithms aiming to perform tasks more efficiently and/or complex than humans. It is based on autonomous learning and works with data."*

**Definition 6**: *"Artificial intelligence is knowledge developed on a specific domain, virtual or material, which can potentially be improved. AI is used for the benefit of humans."*
