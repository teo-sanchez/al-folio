ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º I obtained a Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) postdoctoral fellowship from the European Commission. I will be working for two years at LMU, at the Munich Interactive Intelligence Initiative (MI3), with Prof. Ophelia Deroy. My project *How does human agency shape machine learning understanding?* will be starting on the 1st of January 2025. Looking forward to start this exciting collaboration!
