I have been awarded a Franco-Bavarian mobility funding from [BayFrance](https://www.bayern-france.org), the french-bavarian centre for university cooperation. Together with [Dr. Baptiste Caramiaux](https://baptistecaramiaux.com/), we will be working on our project "Citizens teaching machines: participatory training and auditing of AI systems".
