I am a postdoctoral researcher specializing in human-AI interaction at the [Munich Center for Digital Sciences and AI](), at [Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences]. Starting january 2025, I will be a [Marie-Skłodowska Curie (MSCA) fellow]() at the [Munich Interactive Intelligence Initiative (MI3)]() at [LMU](), working with Prof. Ophelia Deroy. My project will investigate *How does human agency shape machine learning understanding?*

My primary research focus is on understanding how people comprehend and can interact with AI systems. I am interested in designing both inclusive and reflective interactions with machine learning systems.

Second, I study communities of practice that develop around AI technology in the creative and cultural industries. This thread of research spans from the study of early artists that incorporated AI in their practice in the latter half of 2010s, to the recent recreative and online communities centered on text-to-image generation.
