Post-doctoral researcher working on **human-AI interaction**. I did my Ph.D. in [ExSitu](https://ex-situ.lri.fr/) research team, [LISN](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/) and [HCI](https://hci.isir.upmc.fr/) team in [ISIR](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/).

Iâ€™m interested in understanding how people comprehend and interact with AI systems, and designing meaningful interactions with machine learning algorithms.

I'm especially working on teachable ML systems in which people can simultaneously generating the training data of interest and in using modelâ€™s predictions.
